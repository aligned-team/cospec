## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Delta and living-spec parsing tolerances

cospec's delta/living-spec parser SHALL normalise its input before scanning for
requirement and scenario headers: it SHALL strip a leading UTF-8 BOM, normalise
`\r\n` and bare `\r` to `\n`, mask HTML comment spans (including one left
unterminated to end of file), and compute code-fence state with upstream's
`buildCodeFenceMask` semantics — both ```and`~~~` fences, where a closing fence
MUST use the same marker character as the opening fence and be at least as long.
Masking SHALL blank content in place so every reported line number is unchanged.
Requirement and scenario headers inside a masked span SHALL NOT be counted by
any rule or by either hard archive gate.

#### Scenario: BOM-prefixed spec is parsed

- **WHEN** a delta or living `spec.md` begins with a UTF-8 BOM
- **THEN** its first `### Requirement:` header is recognised, exactly as if the
  BOM were absent

#### Scenario: CRLF line endings are parsed

- **WHEN** a spec file uses `\r\n` line endings
- **THEN** requirement and scenario headers are recognised and reported line
  numbers match the file's own line numbering

#### Scenario: Commented-out headers are not counted

- **WHEN** a `### Requirement:` or `#### Scenario:` header sits inside an
  `<!-- ... -->` span
- **THEN** it contributes nothing to the requirement/scenario counts used by
  validation or by the scenario-preservation gate

#### Scenario: A longer fence does not invert fence state

- **WHEN** a spec documents markdown inside a four-backtick fence containing a
  three-backtick line
- **THEN** fence state is closed only by a fence using the same marker and at
  least the opening length, so headers after the block are still counted

#### Scenario: Tilde fences are honored

- **WHEN** a spec uses `~~~` fences around a block containing a `#### Scenario:`
  line
- **THEN** that line is treated as fenced content and not counted as a scenario

#### Scenario: Masking preserves line numbers

- **WHEN** a rule reports an issue on a line following a masked comment or fence
  span
- **THEN** the reported line number equals the line's position in the original
  file

### Requirement: Recursive capability discovery

cospec SHALL discover capability spec files through one shared module
(`core/spec-paths.ts`) used by `cospec validate`, the scenario-preservation
gate, and the post-archive spot check. Discovery SHALL recurse into nested
directories, skip dot-directories, emit posix-style ids sorted by id, and derive
a delta or living file's capability from the file's **immediate parent
directory** rather than the first path segment. It SHALL resolve a symlinked
`spec.md` that stays inside its capability directory, reject a link resolving
outside it, and skip a dangling link. It SHALL swallow only `ENOENT` while
reading a directory and SHALL propagate every other error rather than silently
returning a short list.

#### Scenario: Nested capability resolves to its own directory

- **WHEN** a change carries a delta at `specs/<area>/<capability>/spec.md`
- **THEN** validation, the scenario-preservation gate, and the post-archive spot
  check all resolve its capability to `<capability>`, not `<area>`

#### Scenario: Nested living specs are enumerated

- **WHEN** `openspec/specs/` contains capabilities nested under an area
  directory
- **THEN** the living-capability list used by validation includes every nested
  capability, keyed by its posix id

#### Scenario: An escaping symlink is rejected

- **WHEN** a capability's `spec.md` is a symlink resolving outside that
  capability's directory
- **THEN** discovery reports an error for that capability rather than including
  it

#### Scenario: An unreadable directory is not silently dropped

- **WHEN** reading a directory under `openspec/specs/` fails with anything other
  than `ENOENT`
- **THEN** the error propagates and the command fails loudly instead of
  proceeding with a partial capability list

### Requirement: Root-level specs/spec.md is refused

cospec SHALL raise a named ERROR when a change places a delta at `specs/spec.md`
with no capability directory, rather than silently bucketing it under a
capability literally named `spec.md`. The message SHALL name the expected
`specs/<capability>/spec.md` layout.

#### Scenario: Root-level delta is an error

- **WHEN** `cospec validate` runs on a change containing `specs/spec.md`
- **THEN** it emits a named ERROR pointing at the missing capability directory
  and does not report a capability named `spec.md`

### Requirement: Placeholder Purpose is flagged

The `specs/purpose-tbd` rule SHALL fire both for the archive-generated
`TBD - created by archiving` text it matches today and for a `## Purpose`
section whose first non-blank line opens with a `TBD` or `TODO` marker at a word
boundary. The rule id and its WARNING severity (ERROR under `--strict`) SHALL be
unchanged, an empty `## Purpose` SHALL keep its existing handling, and the two
placeholder forms SHALL NOT both fire for one spec.

#### Scenario: Leading TODO purpose is flagged

- **WHEN** a capability spec's `## Purpose` begins with `TODO: describe this`
- **THEN** `cospec validate` emits `specs/purpose-tbd` as a WARNING, and as an
  ERROR under `--strict`

#### Scenario: Archive placeholder still fires once

- **WHEN** a `## Purpose` carries the archive-generated
  `TBD - created by archiving` text
- **THEN** `specs/purpose-tbd` fires exactly once for that spec

#### Scenario: Empty purpose is unchanged

- **WHEN** a capability spec's `## Purpose` section is empty
- **THEN** the issues reported for that spec are unchanged from before this
  change

### Requirement: Delegated duplicates are suppressed

When cospec merges delegated OpenSpec issues into its own report, it SHALL
suppress a delegated issue that duplicates a native cospec issue already
reported for the same file and the same defect — the placeholder `Purpose`, a
root-level `specs/spec.md`, and scenario loss in a MODIFIED delta. Suppression
SHALL apply only when the native rule actually fired; when cospec's own rule is
silent, the delegated issue SHALL still be reported so nothing is lost.

#### Scenario: One diagnostic per defect

- **WHEN** `cospec validate --strict` runs on a change whose delta thins
  scenarios, and both cospec's own rule and the wrapped binary report it
- **THEN** the merged report contains exactly one issue for that defect, the
  cospec-native one, and the exit code is unchanged

#### Scenario: Unmatched delegated issue survives

- **WHEN** the wrapped binary reports a spec defect that no cospec rule covers
- **THEN** the delegated issue appears in the merged report unchanged
