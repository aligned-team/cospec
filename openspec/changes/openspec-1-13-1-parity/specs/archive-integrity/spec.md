# Spec Delta

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Case-only requirement-name collisions are refused at pre-flight

The archive-precondition rule family SHALL refuse a `## RENAMED` target and an
`## ADDED` name that collides with a living requirement name only in letter case
or in internal whitespace, matching what the wrapped binary refuses when it
builds the updated spec. The comparison SHALL be the same fold the
`archive/target-missing` arm already uses — case-insensitive, with runs of
whitespace collapsed — and the resulting ERROR SHALL be `archive/added-exists`,
with a hint naming the exact living header the name folds onto so the author can
either match it or choose a distinct name.

Two exclusions SHALL hold, because either one gone wrong turns a false archive
PASS into a false refusal. A `## RENAMED` operation's fold check SHALL exclude
the living name its own source occupies, so a case-only rename is applied as a
rename rather than reported as a collision against itself. And the existing
early-sync exemptions SHALL keep applying, so a fold near-miss never resurrects
a collision on an `## ADDED` requirement whose retained block already matches
the living requirement of that name.

Refusal SHALL happen at cospec's own pre-flight, before delegation, so the user
sees cospec's rule id and message rather than a late abort from inside the
delegated merge.

#### Scenario: A case-only ADDED collision is refused

- **WHEN** an `## ADDED` requirement is named `User Auth` and the living spec
  carries `### Requirement: User auth`
- **THEN** `cospec validate --strict` reports `archive/added-exists` with a hint
  naming the living header, and `cospec archive` refuses at pre-flight rather
  than at delegation

#### Scenario: A spacing-only ADDED collision is refused

- **WHEN** an `## ADDED` requirement is named `User  Auth` and the living spec
  carries `### Requirement: User Auth`
- **THEN** `archive/added-exists` is an ERROR

#### Scenario: A case-only RENAMED target is refused

- **WHEN** a `## RENAMED` operation's target folds equal to a living requirement
  name that is not its own source
- **THEN** `archive/added-exists` is an ERROR

#### Scenario: A case-only rename is not a collision

- **WHEN** a `## RENAMED` operation renames `Foo` to `foo`, so its target folds
  equal to the living name its own source occupies and to no other
- **THEN** no `archive/added-exists` issue is raised and the archive proceeds

#### Scenario: An early-synced ADDED is not resurrected by the fold

- **WHEN** an `## ADDED` requirement's retained block matches the living
  requirement of the same name under OpenSpec's normalisation, and a fold-equal
  living name exists only because it is that same requirement
- **THEN** no `archive/added-exists` issue is raised and the archive proceeds

#### Scenario: cospec and the binary agree in both directions

- **WHEN** the contract suite runs a case-only collision and a case-only rename
  against the pinned openspec binary
- **THEN** cospec refuses exactly the delta the binary refuses and accepts
  exactly the delta the binary accepts, so neither a false archive PASS nor a
  false refusal survives the suite
